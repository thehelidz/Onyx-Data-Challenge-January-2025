This small project holds a PowerBI Dashboard created for the ZoomCharts hosted "Onyx Data January 2025 Challenge". 
In here I saved the multiple versions of the PowerBI I created using the data provided for the challenge. 
The basic idea was applying what I already knew in PowerBI aswell as explore new ways to display different forms of data.
